A train is formed of at least two carriages. A carriage has a number of seats, which are identified by a row number, and a letter indicating the position within the row (e.g 48A, 26D). Your booking company sells tickets to reserve a seat between two stations. Tickets may be sold for either first class travel or standard class travel. First class seats may be all in a single carriage, or in a separate section within the same carriage as standard class seats.

A carriage may have no seats, as in the case of the buffet car; or it may have beds in place of seats, as in the case of a sleeper carriage. 

Customers book tickets, and reserve seats. Reservations are confirmed with a code allowing customers to collect their tickets. 

Customers travelling on the train are referred to as passengers. A reservation must be paired with a booking, but a booking need not necessarily be associated with a reservation. 

Extensions:
-----
- Seats may be window or aisle, forward-facing or rear-facing.
- Some train operators number their seats with sequential numbers only.
- In trains of 6 carriages or more, one carriage is designated a "quiet carriage" where mobile phones, music, etc., may not be used.
- Sleeper carriages are sold by the bed, or by the cabin. There are 6 beds in a cabin, and a group of 4-6 may reserve a whole cabin.
